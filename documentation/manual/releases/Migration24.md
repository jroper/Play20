# Play 2.4 Migration Guide

This guide is for migrating to Play 2.4 from Play 2.3. To migrate to Play 2.3, first follow the [[Play 2.3 Migration Guide|Migration23]].

## Body Parsers

The default body parser is now `play.api.mvc.BodyParsers.parse.default`. It is similar to `anyContent` parser, except that it only parses the bodies of PATCH, POST, and PUT requests. To parse bodies for requests of other methods, explicitly pass the `anyContent` parser to `Action`.

```scala
def foo = Action(play.api.mvc.BodyParsers.parse.anyContent) { request =>
  Ok(request.body.asText)
}
```

### Maximum body length

For both Scala and Java, there have been some small but important changes to the way the configured maximum body lengths are handled and applied.

A new property, `parsers.disk.maxLength`, specifies the maximum length of any body that is parsed by a parser that may buffer to disk.  This includes the raw body parser and the `multipart/form-data` parser.  By default this is 10MB.

In the case of the `multipart/form-data` parser, the aggregate length of all of the text data parts is limited by the configured `parsers.text.maxLength` value, which defaults to 100KB.

In all cases, when one of the max length parsing properties is exceeded, a 413 response is returned.  This includes Java actions who have explicitly overridden the `maxLength` property on the `BodyParser.Of` annotation - previously it was up to the Java action to check the `RequestBody.isMaxSizeExceeded` flag if a custom max length was configured, this flag has now been deprecated.

Additionally, Java actions may now declare a `BodyParser.Of.maxLength` value that is greater than the configured max length.
